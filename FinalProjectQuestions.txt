FINAL PROJECT

conflicts between jQuery and Leaflet? (using multiple Javascript libraries in same document?)
is there way to view js scripts in developer mode
use window object for sizing layer div?
link to files in js?

GITHUB
establishing repository? (doesn't recognize git commands)

LEAFLET
div for layers keeps spilling over, even when inserted in same section as map div
-->possible solution: dynamically add layers via jQuery or Leaflet on loading? (find div w/ id "map", change html or text etc)
	-->concern about having css class loaded before layer div loads? 
-->call on other JS files? (for massive large geojson file?)

NOTES
.extend=have other icons in javascript, expand rules to those as well
don't use unless 

curly braces=tells JS it's (usually) an object

JSON objects


TO DO
Add right click event to pull open layer menu
Add div for menu into map pane (Javascript)
Add data
Break JS into several diff files
